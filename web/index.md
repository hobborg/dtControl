**dtControl** is a tool for compressing memoryless controllers arising out of automatic controller synthesis of cyber-physical systems (CPS). dtControl takes as input a controller synthesised by various formal verification tools and represents them in the form of decision trees. In the process, the size of the controller is reduced greatly, and at the same time, it becomes more explainable. While in principle, memoryless strategies in any format can be handled by dtControl, currently it supports controllers output by two tools: [SCOTS](https://gitlab.lrz.de/matthias/SCOTSv0.2) and [Uppaal Stratego](https://people.cs.aau.dk/~marius/stratego/index.html).

## Quick Start

You can quickly install dtControl by running the following command

```
pip install dtcontrol
```

Check whether dtControl has installed by running

```
dtcontrol --version
```

As a quick example, you may download the controller generated by SCOTS for the Cartpole example by running

```
wget https://pages.gitlab.lrz.de/i7/dtcontrol/raw/9a559576795e60f1937d8cb288650fd79e041f36/examples/cartpole.scs.zip \
&& unzip cartpole.scs.zip
```

following which you may use dtControl to generate a decision tree.

```
dtcontrol --input cartpole.scs --determinize maxfreq
```

The above command, if executed successfully, will generate a files `benchmark.html`, `benchmark.json` and a folder `decision_trees` which contain the output of the run. You may open the `benchmark.html` file in any browser to access the generated trees.
