title: dtControl

summary: Represent controllers as decision trees. Improve memory footprint, boost explainability while preserving guarantees.

---

**dtControl** is a tool for compressing memoryless controllers, e.g. arising out of automatic controller synthesis of 
cyber-physical systems (CPS) or probabilistic model checking. dtControl takes as input a controller synthesised by various formal verification 
tools and represents them in the form of decision trees. An example is shown below:

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="image-container">
<div class="fixed">
<img src="assets/images/10rooms-pause-loop.gif" />
<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>
<div class="flex-item">
<img src="assets/images/10rooms-dt.png" />
<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>
</div>

Currently dtControl supports controller output generated by the tools [SCOTS](https://www.hcs.ei.tum.de/en/software/scots/),
[Uppaal Stratego](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~marius/stratego/), [PRISM](http://prismmodelchecker.org/),
and [Storm](https://www.stormchecker.org/).


To learn more about dtControl and representing controllers using decision trees, you may want to watch our [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS8FQ3pCeE4)
or [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6d3pS6Ege0) at HSCC 2020, take a look at our 
[tool manual](https://dtcontrol.readthedocs.io) or read our [HSCC 2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04991).
The latest features including support of algebraic predicates, categorical predicates, a semi-automatic interface, 
GUI with several interactive modes, new determinization procedure and an interface for model checkers PRISM and Storm, 
can be found in our latest [TACAS 2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07202).
 

## Quick Start

You can quickly install **dtControl** by running the following command

```
pip install dtcontrol
```

Check whether **dtControl** has installed by running

```
dtcontrol --version
```

As a quick example, you may download the controller generated by SCOTS for the climate control example shown above by running

```
wget https://gitlab.lrz.de/i7/dtcontrol/raw/6dd07a5991a0e0a7992c9f7c94e1b9c75c7d94e3/examples/10rooms.scs.zip \
&& unzip 10rooms.scs.zip
```

following which you may use **dtControl** to generate a decision tree.

```
dtcontrol --input 10rooms.scs --use-preset maxfreq
```

The above command, if executed successfully, will generate a files `benchmark.html`, `benchmark.json` and a folder `decision_trees` which contain the output of the run. You may open the `benchmark.html` file in any browser to access the generated trees.

## Manuals / Documentation

Our complete documentation including user and developer manuals are available at [dtcontrol.readthedocs.io](https://dtcontrol.readthedocs.io). Please ensure that you are referring to the correct version of the documentation. Additionally, we provide [video tutorials][2], covering the most aspects of **dtControl**.

## Artifact evaluation

**dtControl** has undergone several artifact evaluation processes. All the resources for that are available [here][1].
