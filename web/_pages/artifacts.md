# Artifact Evaluation Resources

Here we give the resources for all artifact evaluation or repeatability evaluation processes dtControl has undergone:

- [HSCC2020 (publication "dtControl: Decision Tree Learning Algorithms for Controller Representation")][1]
- [QEST2020 (tool demonstration without associated publication)][2]
- [TACAS2021 (submission under review "dtControl 2.0: Explainable Strategy Representation via Decision Tree Learning Steered by Experts"][3]
