# Artifact Evaluation Instructions: HSCC 2020 paper 

Here we give the instructions for the repeatability evaluation for the HSCC 2020 paper **dtControl: Decision Tree Learning Algorithms for Controller Representation**.

You can download the [instructions][1] and the [zip file with the sources][2].
Note that the version of dtControl in the zip-file is more than a year old and hence quite different from the current version. 
You can also download the newest version of dtControl to reproduce the table from the HSCC20 paper, as all the presets we used there are still available.
