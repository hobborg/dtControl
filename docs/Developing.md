## Setting up the dev environment
```bash
# Clone the repo 
git clone git@gitlab.com:live-lab/software/dtcontrol.git
cd dtcontrol
# Initialize and update the examples submodule
# (this would work if you have cloned it using ssh, i.e., not HTTPS)
git submodule update --init examples

# Install the python dependencies
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
# Run dtControl
./bin/dtcontrol
```

## Simple example
The examples are present in the directory `examples/`. 
We try to execute generate a decision treee for the controller `10rooms` generated by [SCOTS](https://webarchiv.typo3.tum.de/EI/hcs/en/software/scots/). The following commands should produce files in the directory `decision_trees/`.

```bash
cd examples/cps/
unzip 10rooms.scs.zip
cd ../..
./bin/dtControl --input examples/cps/10rooms.scs
```

## Running the Web App
The following command should start the GUI Web App for dtControl:
```bash
python -m dtcontrol.frontend.app
```
More information about using the web app [here](https://dtcontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userman.html#web-based-graphical-user-interface)
