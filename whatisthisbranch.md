# Why does this branch exist?

This branch fixes two bugs:

1. The experiment id (#-column in the experiments-table) was generated by counting the rows in the table and adding 1. This is of course a bad idea for multiple reasons, e.g. when experiments get deleted, the experiments added afterwards get an ids that were already assigned before. Furthermore, when the page is reloaded (e.g. because you return to it after looking at a decision tree), all experiment just get a new id instead of recovering the original ones. Therefore, every experiment now gets a unique id assigned when it is added to the experiments table in app.py.
2. The results were identified by their respective experiment id. This was a bad idea, because you could run the same experiment multiple times, making it impossible to distinguish results by the experiment id. This led to many different problems, for example that the "Running..." status of a second execution of an experiment never got updated. Now, every result gets a unique result id based on the number of rows already in the table. This works because results cannot be deleted from the results table.

There is still another bug (that already existed before):

When more than two experiments are executed at the same time, this does not take twice the time, but overproportionally more time until both are finished. This scales very badly for multiple experiments at the same time and longer execution times...
